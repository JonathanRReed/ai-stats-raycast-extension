# AI-Stats (Raycast Extension)

A Raycast extension that provides quick access to AI model statistics and leaderboards.
It connects to a Supabase database (hosted by Jonathan Reed) that syncs with [ArtificialAnalysis.ai](https://artificialanalysis.ai/).
Search models, view benchmark results, compare prices, and check leaderboards — all without leaving Raycast.
